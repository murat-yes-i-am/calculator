# Calculator Project

This project summarizes what I've learned through topics of the Foundations course of the Odin Project.
You can interact with it using the keyboard â€”button text corresponds to a key on the keyboard. For example, pressing '8' will enter 8 into the calculator display, pressing '/' will launch the division operation, or pressing' ESC' will reset the calculator.

Feel free to play with it.
